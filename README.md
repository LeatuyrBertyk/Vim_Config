# VimConfig
This is my configuration to make Vim text editor as an IDE.

<h2>1. What is Vim?</h2>

Vim is simply a lightweight text editor. Unlike VS Code or Sublime Text, its initial interface looks like almost nothing. What makes Vim special is that it boosts your typing speed by using shortcuts that are quite different from the norm. To understand how to use it, you can look up **vimtutor** online.

To make the experience more convenient, Vim supports many plugins, and below is my configuration to turn Vim into an IDE.
